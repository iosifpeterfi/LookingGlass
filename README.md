# LookingGlass

## Overview

LookingGlass is a user-friendly PHP based looking glass that allows the public (via a web interface) to execute network 
commands on behalf of your server.

## Demo

[LookingGlass](http://lg.iamtelephone.com)

The demo is hosted on a 50MB (RAM) VPS. 502 errors may occur in events of high use.

## Features

* Automated install via bash script
* IPv4 & IPv6 support
* Live output via long polling
* Multiple themes
* Rate limiting of network commands

## Implemented commands

* host
* mtr
* mtr6 (IPv6)
* ping
* ping6 (IPv6)
* traceroute
* traceroute6 (IPv6)

__IPv6 commands will only work if your server has external IPv6 setup (or tunneled)__

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.3
* PHP PDO
* SSH/Terminal access (able to install commands/functions if non-existent)

## Install

1. Download LookingGlass
2. Navigate to the `LookingGlass` subdirectory in terminal
3. Run `bash configure.sh`
4. Follow the instructions and `configure.sh` will take care of the rest
5. Restrict access of web client for LookingGlass subdirectory content. Either through .htaccess or web server config. The files do not need to be accessed directly on web, especially ratelimit.db. 


_Forgot a setting? Simply run the `configure.sh` script again_

## Nginx

To enable output buffering on Nginx, please append the following to your PHP configuration:

```nginx
location ~ \.php$ {
    ...

    # Append the following
    fastcgi_buffer_size   1k;
    fastcgi_buffers       128 1k;
    fastcgi_max_temp_file_size 0;
    gzip off;
}
```

I recommend that you create a separate host file for LookingGlass OR a directory specific PHP "location". This is due 
to these settings not being optimal for conventional use.
